## Overview of the Project

### Project: Password Strenght Checker

### Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate the strength of user-created passwords, encouraging secure password practices by providing real-time feedback and improvement suggestions. It educates users on security standards and helps prevent unauthorized access by enforcing strong password criteria.

## Key Activities
- **Research**: Define password strength criteria (length, complexity, uniqueness).
- **Algorithm Design:** Develop a scoring system to evaluate password strength.
- **Testing:** Test with various passwords for accuracy and reliability.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for developing the password evaluation logic.
- **password_strength library:** A third-party Python library that provides tools to evaluate password strength, including methods like strength() and entropy_bits.
- **Input Handling:** Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in input() function to capture user input.
- **Conditional Logic:** if-else statements to assess password attributes like length, complexity, and uniqueness.
- **Basic Math:** Simple calculations to compute an overall password strength score.
